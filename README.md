# ABOUT
### Welcome to the Encoded Calculator repository! 
### This project is a unique calculator application implemented in C#. It provides a secure and fun way to perform mathematical calculations by encoding the input and displaying the results in an encoded format. 
### The Encoded Calculator offers an exciting twist to traditional calculators, making it an intriguing tool for puzzle enthusiasts, cryptography enthusiasts, or anyone looking for a different calculation experience.

# FEATURES
- ### Input encoding: The calculator employs a custom encoding algorithm that transforms the user's input into an encoded format. This encoding mechanism ensures that the input remains secure and provides an additional layer of complexity to the calculations.

- ### Encoded results: The calculator not only encodes the input but also displays the results in an encoded format. This feature adds an element of challenge and mystery to the calculations, encouraging users to decode the results to unveil the answers.

- ### Basic arithmetic operations: The application supports essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input encoded values and obtain encoded results, which they can then decode to reveal the actual mathematical outcomes.

- ### Interactive decoding: The calculator includes an interactive decoding feature that allows users to decode the encoded results effortlessly. By simply interacting with the interface, users can uncover the encoded answers and verify the accuracy of their calculations.
